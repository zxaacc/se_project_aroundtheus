Around The U.S.

This project contains images from beutiful sights around the United States.

This project was meant for me to practice my HTML, CSS, and use Figma for the first time. The page was started from scratch and the design was from Figma.

It uses flexbox and grid to display the items on the page, it also is meant to be supported on 3 diffrent displays 320px (Mobile), 800px (Tablet), 1280px (Laptop), these are the most common devices that could be used to access the site.

The site is not functional but maybe in the future it could be improved to be.
