Around The U.S.

This project contains images from beutiful sights around the United States.

This project was meant for me to practice my HTML, CSS, and use Figma for the first time. The page was started from scratch and the design was from Figma.

It uses flexbox and grid to display the items on the page, it also is meant to be supported on 3 diffrent displays 320px (Mobile), 800px (Tablet), 1280px (Laptop), these are the most common devices that could be used to access the site.

The site is currently being worked on to be become funtional with what I've been taught about in this sprint, it basic JavaScript so its nothing too fancy.

I've had a lot of fun coding the small popup box, I built it using HTML, I used a <form> to add the name and description input fields, and placeholders to show what needs to be typed in each box. I styled it with simple CSS and positioned it with fixed positoning.

I also had a lot of fun customizing the cards of the page and adding some of the places that I would love to visit in the future.
